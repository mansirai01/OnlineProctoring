1. Find the pixel values of the image if it has been coded in a) 5-bit resolution b) 3-bit resolution
Explain the effect of image visual perception on changing the image intensity resolution with
above parameters.
2. Interpolate a pixel using Bilinear interpolation method at location (1.25,1.75) and find its
Intensity value with 8-bit resolution image as given in Q.1 (4 Marks)
3. Find the output image pixel value is hard thresholding function is applied on image given in Q.1 with threshold value as (mean â€“ x) where x is LAST TWO DIGITS OF SCHOLAR NUMBER/100
