# OnlineProctoring

It's an automated proctoring system that uses a webcam and microphone to observe the user during the examination.
It aids exam proctoring by tracking eyeball movements, head-pose estimation, mouth opening detection, mobile phone detection, and instance segmentation to count the number of persons present in front of the camera and indicate if no one or more than one person is there.
It also records audio from the microphone and shows the number and list of words said, that are on the question paper to the proctor.
It improves the efficiency and ease of invigilation for examiners.
